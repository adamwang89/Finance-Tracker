## Why Use Finance Tracker

Financial literacy is an important skill for everyone to have as they are growing. Being in college, this topic has become extremely prevelant for me. Money doesn't grow on trees and the hope with this app is to allow people to see how much they are spending and to really reconsider buying new things. On top of being something that can help raise awareness, I wanted to build something useful that everyone can use while highlighting the themes of: redux and react hooks.
